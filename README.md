# One Stop Bike Shop
### I have designed this to give the novice bike owner some small amounts of information to help them maintain their bike. The site also has Bike, Tool, and clothing sales, none of these work but they could be further developed in other project on the course.
### The site could be further developed to show clips of maintenance activities as well as the photos and text that detail the task.
# UX
### The basic idea of the site is to enable someone with limited knowledge of a mountain bike to be able to maintain their bike and to ensure that ii it safe before ever ride. So far I have only populated the Front Wheel section of the site.
### The basic format of the site was something that I have used many times in the IETPs that I have created during my work as a technical author. As a result of this I have not used any other forms of design tools as I knew how I wanted the site to look and the functionality I thought it needed in order to fit into assignment criteria.
### This site was a template taken from Bootstrap and then adapted for the needs of the site, I have some rough wireframes that I created. 
<img src="/assets/figures/Desktop.png" style="margin: 1px;">;
### The is the wirfame for the desktop applications, this allows for the section that defines the sales items to be displayed in three columns.
<img src="/assets/figures/Mobile.png" style="margin: 1px;">;
### This wireframe is for mobile divices and allows the sales section to be displayed in a single column, this is due to the smaller screen sizes of these devices.
### The site was developed to give the user access to some basic maintenance information, that could be changed once a month for example, then giving the new bike owners some interesting and useful things to buy.
# Features
### Once the site is finished the site will allow novice and experienced users to maintain their bikes, using some of the detailed procedures and the sales section of the site to buy the tools they may need.
### The site caters for both male and female riders, the site could be developed to have video clips of the maintenance tasks.
### Also places to visit could be added, this could be broken down into easy route and placing harder routes in clearly marks sections of the site.

### I used nothing too fancy, just some basic Bootstrap and links to pages, the site is a very simple one. I want to keep things simple, as I feel complicating things adds a layer of confusion which no one needs.
# Testing
### I have tried to make sure that the site behaves the same way for all type of devices using the Bootstrap grid system.
###  I would have tested the site on a focus group, but as the site is not finished and finishing it would take lots more time than I have, I have not used any third party groups.

# Deployment
### My site will be deployed using GitHub Pages. We seem to have been led into using GitHub on the course and as I know of no other way of hosting this is the one chosen.
