Making a cup of tea.
This is a simple task that most people in the UK do, but one that is fraught with dangers. I have used a style of writing that is close to the specification I work with and write to.
There are various sections that can be referenced out, these are Required Conditions, Tools, Supplies, Spares, Persons Required. Each referenced section contains information needed.
The project was supposed to have a CSS and several referenced pages, the style.css is a simple one that contains the images in a similar way to the other projects we have done, the resume project had the reference sections in a div tag, I have used tables, they donâ€™t do the same thing, but give a similar result.
The main document is the Task.html from this page you can see all the other referenced documents and navigate to where you want to be.
